# How to finance

*this is a draft*

- Individual donation: someone puts money in advance. she holds rights of that property.
- Collective donation (crowdfunding): some people put money in advance. That people decides how to manage the rights of that property. By default the collective holds the rights of that property (collectivized)
- Investment / compensation / loan: someone or some people advanced money but they would want to recover it. As an exchange the property rights should be negociated. By default the collective holds the rights of that property (collectivized)
    - recovery applying a fixed and unique tax for each new installation / user
    - recovery applying a regular tax per each new installation / user until some balance, 3 examples: -15%, 0%, 15%
        - This use case is very common in optical fiber deployments in guifi. Users that pay after the deployment is done pay +50% extra (investors: 1000€, late user: 1500€)
