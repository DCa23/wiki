Deploy your own meet.jit.si service

First of all I recommend that before starting this guide you have a public IP directly attached to the server jitsi is going to be installed. Jitsi allows NAT, etc. but I could not make it work without that public IP. If you can, please share it and I will put it here.

# Quick install instructions

https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md

# Disable jicofo health check

/etc/jitsi/jicofo/sip-communicator.properties

    org.jitsi.jicofo.HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=-1

and restart jicofo

    service jicofo restart

## Why

Read if you are interested on knowing why this option is recommended

[As said by a jitsi developer](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/2172#issuecomment-389589242) health checks are for environments with multiple jvbs instances; in other words, there is no sense to have the health check for a single jvb instance. [The problem](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/2172) (at least with a single jvb instance) is that the healthcheck opens supposedly too much UDP ports that are not immediately closed after the healtcheck, hence, jicofo crashes and "jitsi is not working"

# Disable third party stuff

Third party stuff example: the random funny avatars

/etc/jitsi/meet/meet.tips.es-config.js

    disableThirdPartyRequests: true,

# Enable Screen Capture for Firefox

```diff
- desktopSharingFirefoxDisabled: true,
+ desktopSharingFirefoxDisabled: false,
// (...)
- desktopSharingFirefoxMaxVersionExtRequired: -1,
+ desktopSharingFirefoxMaxVersionExtRequired: 51,
```

src https://github.com/jitsi/jidesha/blob/master/firefox/README.md#deprecation

# Enable Screen Capture for Chromium/Chrome

## DIY

Do what official documentation says: https://github.com/jitsi/jidesha/blob/master/chrome/README.md#create-the-extension

I suggest:

    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/jitsi/jidesha
    cd jidesha

What is missing after that is how to generate the crx. Let's go!

Requirements for debian 9 (src https://stackoverflow.com/a/33432126):

    sudo apt install rubygems-integration ruby ruby-dev

After that install the application that does the crx

    sudo gem install crxmake

Assuming we are in the same directory (the git repository) we generate the pack extension with the chrome directory:

    crxmake --pack-extension chrome

after that you will see in the same directory `chrome.crx`

drag it to your extensions in chrome/chromium and copy the `id`

In your jitsi server (replace example.com with your domain) `/etc/jitsi/meet/meet.example.com-config.js` paste your `id`:

```diff
- desktopSharingChromeExtId: 'diibjkoicjeejcmhdnailmkgecihlobk',
+ desktopSharingChromeExtId: 'myidisherelalalalalalalalalalala',
```

## Optional additional step: facilitate DIY

You can put a message in the welcome page explaining how to install chrome/chromium extension:

/usr/share/jitsi-meet/index.html

[catalan]

```diff
   </head>
   <body>
+    &nbsp;
+    <p align="center" style="user-select: auto !important; -webkit-user-select: auto !important;">Si utilitzes Chromium/Chrome cal descarregar un plugin per compartir pantalla <a href="https://meet.guifi.net/chrome.crx" target="_blank" style="user-select: auto !important; -webkit-user-select: auto !important;">aquí</a>. Després ves a <strong style="user-select: auto !important; -webkit-user-select: auto !important;">chrome://extensions</strong> i des d'allà arrastra el addon per instal·lar-lo</p>

   </head>
   <body>
+    &nbsp;
+    <p align="center" style="user-select: auto !important; -webkit-user-select: auto !important;">If you use Chromium/Chrome you have to download a plugin to share your screen <a href="https://meet.guifi.net/chrome.crx" target="_blank" style="user-select: auto !important; -webkit-user-select: auto !important;">here</a>. After that go to <strong style="user-select: auto !important; -webkit-user-select: auto !important;">chrome://extensions</strong> and drag there the addon to install it</p>
+    &nbsp;
     <div id="react"></div>
     <div id="keyboard-shortcuts" class="keyboard-shortcuts" style="display:none;">
```

## Optional additional step: going official

If you want facilitate plugin installation (as you may see in meet.jit.si) you have to do the following:

- get developer account https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard
- pay 5$ (one time payment) - but you can register limited (20) number of applications in store -> src https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/about_signup
- Verify that this is an official item for a website you own (add new, select), scp html that gives google to /usr/share/jitsi-meet (remember to use https, and set https as the url, redirection won't work)
- check `inline install` -> src info about inline install https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/inline_installation?hl=en-US
- Verify that this is an official item for a website you own -> src https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25920728/how-to-specify-verified-site-to-a-chrome-app
- put `visibility options` as `unlisted`

# Troubleshooting

Important logs to inspect

- /var/log/jitsi/jicofo.log - jitsi meet (javascript, and binding to videobridge and prosody)
- /var/log/jitsi/jvb.log - jitsi videobridge
- /var/log/prosody/prosody.log - XMPP server (chat, room allocation)

try restarting services (or reboot):

    service jicofo restart
    service jitsi-videobridge restart
    service prosody restart

## Chromium/Chrome: Screen sharing extension failed to install

In the console log (F12) says: [modules/RTC/ScreenObtainer.js] <Object.handleExtensionInstallationError>:  Failed to install the extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pghfcfjjnafginnjcndefbljohonelcp Inline installs can only be initiated for Chrome Web Store items that have one or more verified sites.

Verify the site
