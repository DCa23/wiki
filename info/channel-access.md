[CSMA/CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance) (802.11 / Wifi) vs [TDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiple_access) => TDMA wins

Hypothesis: proliferation of solutions like airmax (ubiquiti) and nv2 (mikrotik) technologies are affecting negatively the shared use of spectrum on unlicensed bands. This is even worst with LTE technology that is going to use unlicensed spectrum.

There is no open source TDMA solution. If you usually use opensource, you will need to use this propietary link protocols as dummy devices (in bridge mode)
